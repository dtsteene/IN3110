In this project-based course centered around problem-solving with Python, I completed several projects, with the final three being the most engaging and substantial.

The initial standout project required us to create a package installable via pip that could apply filters to images. We worked with .toml files for setting up the package and utilized Numba for its Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to enhance our code's performance. In addition, we implemented line profilers to further optimize our code.

For our next project, we ventured into web scraping, gathering NBA statistics from Wikipedia. The task was to isolate the three leading players from the 2020/2021 season in terms of points, rebounds, and assists for every team. We became proficient with the urllib module for making HTML requests, BeautifulSoup and regular expressions for parsing HTML, and also dabbled in asyncio to efficiently handle web requests asynchronously, as most of the time spent web-scraping is spent waiting for the server response. 

The final project involved creating a straightforward website using FastAPI, which we documented with Sphinx. The website was designed to display current electricity prices in Norway and detailed the cost of everyday activities like taking a shower, based on data from hvakosterstr√∏mmen.no. This project allowed us to combine backend development with effective information presentation and documentation.
